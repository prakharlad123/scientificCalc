Scientific Calculator

In this project, we simply build a calculator with minimal functioanlities like (Power, Square root, Factorial, and Logarithm base-10). 

But the main focus of the project is to understand the SDLC and DevOps pipeline.

Here we create a Jenkins pipeline and create a Docker image. Then deploy it on Ansible.

The project contains all the file that are related to the Jenkins pipeline and the ansible-docker playbook.
